## Run this project on your machine
- Clone the project
`git clone https://github.com/MikeyOnyedika/project-manager-app-react.git`

- Open the XAMPP control panel and fire up the mysql server
- open `localhost/phpmyadmin` on your browser
- Create a database and setup a user account for that database to match the specification in backend/.env like as below. 
```env

**Note:** You can also decide to change the database credentials in this backend/.env but make sure they are the same credentials used to create the database in XAMPP
- Open a terminal/Command prompt in root of the project and run `npm start`, then wait for the project to be set up. This may take some time so you may want to go grab a coffee or watch one or two youtube videos or check your messages on facebook/discord/telegram etc. The point is, you have been warned.
